function r = synthesis(mixture, mask, fRange, winLength, fs) 
% synthesize a waveform signal from a mixture signal and a binary mask.
% It amounts to an inverse filter of the gammatone filterbank. 
% The first two variables are required. 
% fRange: frequency range.
% winLength: window (frame) length in samples
% fs: sampling frequency.
